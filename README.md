# Compiler-Design
A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of the program. It is also expected that a compiler should make the target code efficient and optimized in terms of time and space.  Compiler design principles provide an in-depth view of translation and optimization process. Compiler design covers basic translation mechanism and error detection &amp; recovery. It includes lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis as front end, and code generation and optimization as back-end.

Here I have uploaded some of the basic programs that are covered under the subject Compiler Design. Aim of the programs are uploaded in the respective folders, Image of output is also added for your reference.
